[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds a wearable GPS watch to the game.

The watch acts as both a vanilla compass and a GPS in terms of map behaviour.

So if the server has turned on displaying your location with a GPS then this watch will display your position.

It uses pure vanilla code to behave as a GPS so it should be compatible with any mod which checks vanilla code for the compass and GPS item (so it does work with Expansion, not sure about other map mods as I haven't tested it and don't have time to make it compatible for all the various map mods).

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

Make sure to merge the types.xml entry from the "extras" folder inside the mod folder to make the watch spawn and stay persistent.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just make sure to respect the 3D model author's license and keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
